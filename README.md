In this game you need to guess the random letter that the computer is thinking of.  You have nine guesses to get the answer right and if you don't you will get one added to the loses section and the same for winning.  The letters you guess are displayed on the screen and reset everytime there is a win/loss or refresh.  I used Javascript, HTML, and, CSS for this project.  The most challenging thing was registering the keystrokes, I had no idea how to do that or even bring it to the console.  Once my keystrokes were registering to the console the rest of the project was easy, some changes I would have made was not being able to guess the same letter multiple times.  In my game you could guess the letter i nine times.  Another change I would've made was style the game a bit more and have a winner award or alert if the user guesses the letter right.
